upgrade:
  - |
    For deployments with ``nova_backend_ssl: True`` TLS certificates for
    Nova API backends will be re-generated during upgrade. From now on they
    will be suffixed with `_api`.
fixes:
  - |
    PKI role idempotence has been fixed for the ``metal`` scenario when
    nova-compute was placed on the same hosts as nova-api.
    Previously, certificates were re-generated each run due to non-unique
    names.
